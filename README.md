## Project Requirements

Basic Task: 
- Implement a program that reads an arithmetic expression from the standard input
and returns “true”, in case the expression is a valid one, and “false”, otherwise (e.g.,
“11+1.2*3”).

Requirements
- Operands are positive real numbers (e.g., 1, 3.14, 1234).
- Supported operations are “+”, “-”, “*” and “/”.
- Space characters are allowed everywhere in the expression

Extended Task: 
- The program should also support validating expressions containing
parentheses.

Additional Requirements:
- Opening and closing parentheses are allowed - “(“ and “)”.
- Nesting of parenthesis is allowed

## Solution Rating

The rating of the solution given would be done by these prioritized requirements:
1. Functional correctness
2. Automated tests correctness/completeness
3. Clean code
4. Performance

## Notes
- А fully working/tested/clean/performant solution of the Basic Task is considered higher
rated, than a partial one of the Extended Task.
- Implement your solution without using regular expressions.
- Use tool of your choice for build/dependencies management.
- Implement the task(s) with a quality as if they were on the job ones
- Do all the tests needed to ensure solution quality (unit, component, integration
tests, whatever you believe is needed)
- Follow all the SOLID/Clean code/Clean design principles that you think are
applicable
- Think of proper classes, interfaces, and exceptions design
- Etc.
- Provide your solution in GitHub/GitLab account of yours.
